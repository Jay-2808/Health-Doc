## 🚀 Features

### 🧠 AI Health Assistant
An intelligent chatbot built with advanced NLP (Natural Language Processing), offering:
- Multi-language support
- Voice assistant for hands-free interaction
- Direct integration with WhatsApp and Telegram (planned)
- Health-related question answering and navigation help

### 🧬 Disease Diagnosis (Image-Based)
- Users can upload images of affected body parts
- Deep learning and computer vision are used to predict possible diseases
- Especially useful for early detection of skin conditions
- Real-time output displayed on the frontend

### 🌐 Endemic Simulation Models
Interactive real-time simulations using 4 powerful models:
- **SIR Model** – Simulates disease spread using compartmental dynamics
- **LSTM Model** – Predicts time-series data using memory-based neural networks
- **Prophet Model** – Facebook's trend & seasonality forecasting algorithm
- **ARIMA Model** – Classic statistical forecasting for cyclic disease patterns
- Dynamic graphs and particle-based simulations enhance learning and understanding

### 💬 Quotes Generator
- Auto-generated motivational or health-based quotes using APIs
- Displayed dynamically with a typing effect on the homepage

### 🛠️ To Run Backend APIs (like quotes or diagnosis):

Make sure **Python 3** is installed on your system.

#### 💻 Run the Flask backend:

```bash
cd backend/
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

After starting the server, open `index.html` in your browser and explore the app!
